                <p>I recently purchased a home in Liberty Hill that sits on half of an acre in the downtown area and I
                    love it! Being able to get the small town vibe, but still having access to the big city is the ideal
                    balance for me. Before getting into web development, I was in ministry for about 10 years where I
                    worked as a worship pastor and tech coordinator. I learned the value of being able to provide
                    efficient technical instruction, oversight, and leadership. Although ministry and web development
                    don't appear to have much overlap, I've learned that being a part of a highly collaborative team
                    requires the use of many of the skills I learned while in ministry. I've thoroughly enjoyed the
                    transition into web development and the ever-evolving technical expertise required to stay up to
                    date in this industry. I love to learn and I love to help others do the same!</p>
